# Community Science Museum - Semester Project 1

![image](https://roarfh-portifolio.netlify.app/images/s1Project.png)

This project was my semester prosject for the first semester, and was about to design and create a nice looking website for the target audience. The website had to be responsive and had several pages.

## Description

I started with the design job in Figma to find out how my website should look and what each page should contain. I also designed the icons for the cards in the site.

I desided what colors I was going to use based on the target audience.

I really liked working with this project, and the main issues for me was to make the pages responsible, but I made it.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Designing the project in Figma was my first job in this project. I think I made a nice design for the site. with the pink design-elements on the pages. I designed my icons for the cards at the bottom of every page and I really like working in Figma.

Next was to code the project in HTML and CSS. I started with the first page and reused my code for this page on the oter pages.

The cards at the bottom was maybe the hardest to make responsible, but I learned a lot about the media-querys in this project.
